# WPlace userscripts
this repo has one (1) userscript for now, we'll probably add more as we make them
# Prerequisites
Install a userscript manager extension such as [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (OSS) or [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
# Scripts
- Keybinds (addon for BlueMarble, forks supported) - [`press me to install`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gay-coders/wplace-scripts/refs/heads/main/keybinds.user.js) - by [@meqativ](https://github.com/meqativ)
> This adds a ui to blue marble to change the keybind to various stuff on wplace<br/>
